Red String Theory — An Interactive Story Game

Red String Theory is an original interactive story I wrote and programmed for the mobile storytelling platform Episode. The game allows readers to experience a branching narrative where their decisions shape the outcome, leading to alternate paths, relationships, and endings.

I created the full storyline, characters, and dialogue, and implemented everything using Donnacode, Episode’s proprietary scripting language. I self-taught Donnacode to handle advanced scripting features like branching logic, conditional dialogue, overlay animations, and character movements, turning a written story into a fully interactive experience.

✨ Key Features

Choice-driven gameplay: Player decisions dynamically alter the story’s progression and outcome.

Original narrative: A heartfelt story exploring fate, connection, and missed chances — inspired by the Japanese legend of the red string of fate.

Character & visual design: Fully customized characters, emotional expressions, and cinematic scene transitions.

Advanced Donnacode implementation: Utilized complex branching structures, variables, and visual layering to create smooth, immersive storytelling.
